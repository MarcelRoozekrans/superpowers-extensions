# docs/planning/ State Files Reference

This document defines the format for the `docs/planning/` directory files used by
the `project-orchestration` skill to persist project lifecycle state across sessions.

> **Companion templates** for the design specs that feed these state files
> live in `templates/`:
>
> - [`templates/roadmap-design.template.md`](templates/roadmap-design.template.md) — filled in by `plan-roadmap` at roadmap scope
> - [`templates/milestone-design.template.md`](templates/milestone-design.template.md) — filled in by `new-milestone` at milestone scope
> - [`templates/phase-design.template.md`](templates/phase-design.template.md) — filled in by `start-next-phase` (via brainstorming) at phase scope
>
> Filled-in copies are saved under `docs/superpowers/specs/`. The templates make brainstorm output deterministic so VERIFY steps can grep-check required sections (Surface tag, DoD criteria count, milestone count) instead of pattern-matching free-form prose.

## Directory

`docs/planning/` in the project root. Add to `.gitignore` or commit — user's choice.
Recommended: commit so state survives machine changes.

## ROADMAP.md

Tracks all milestones, their phases, and completion status.

```markdown
# Project Roadmap

## Milestone 1: <Name> [status: active|complete|pending]
**Goal:** One sentence
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD (when status: active or complete)
**Milestone:** N (when github sync is enabled — GitHub native milestone number)
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (when status: complete)
**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Phase 1.1: <Name> [status: complete|active|pending]
**Goal:** One sentence
**Surface:** UI | Backend | Refactor | Data | Infra | Docs | Mixed
**HelpWanted:** yes | no
**Plan:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<phase>.md`
**Issue:** #N (when github sync is enabled)
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (when status: complete)

### Phase 1.2: <Name> [status: pending]
...

## Milestone 2: <Name> [status: pending]
...
```

### Canonical syntax — exact bracket and heading rules

These details are easy to drift on; agents must follow them precisely so
state files stay machine-readable across sessions.

- **Heading levels** — milestones use `##`, phases use `###`. Never the other way around.
- **Status bracket** — exactly `[status: active]`, `[status: complete]`, or `[status: pending]`. Lowercase status, single space after the colon, square brackets. Do **not** use parentheses, do **not** drop the `status:` prefix, do **not** capitalize.
- **Status values are exhaustive** — only `active`, `complete`, `pending`. Never `wip`, `done`, `tbd`, `blocked`, or other free-form values. If a phase is blocked, leave its status as `active` and capture the blocker in `STATE.md` instead.
- **Completed date** — always `**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD` on its own line, ISO 8601 dashes, no time component. Add this line only when status transitions to `complete`. Never add it pre-emptively.
- **Surface field** — `**Surface:**` on its own line below `**Goal:**`. Drives `start-next-phase`'s pre-plan routing (UI phases chain through `ui-design-system` + `ui-workflow ui-phase`; refactor phases chain through `refactor-analysis`; others go directly to `writing-plans`). Allowed values, exhaustive: `UI`, `Backend`, `Refactor`, `Data`, `Infra`, `Docs`, `Mixed`. Capitalized exactly as shown, no quotes, single space after the colon. If a phase blends two surfaces equally (e.g. a feature touching both API and UI), use `Mixed` and document the breakdown in the design spec; `start-next-phase` falls back to the default routing for `Mixed` so authors can drive the order manually. Phases authored before this convention existed may omit the field — `start-next-phase` treats missing `Surface` the same as `Mixed`.
- **HelpWanted:** — value is exactly `yes` or `no` (lowercase). Drives the `help wanted` label on `sync-github`. Default `no`. Field is optional; missing is treated as `no`.
- **Issue:** — written by `init-github-sync` on first GitHub-issue creation, read by `sync-github` thereafter. Format is `**Issue:** #N` *with* the leading hash (matches GitHub issue convention). Do not edit manually unless reconciling a deleted issue.
- **Milestone:** — same rules but stores the GitHub native Milestone number *without* a hash. Format is `**Milestone:** N` (just the digit). The two formats differ deliberately so a stray copy-paste between fields is detectable.

### Optional frontmatter — `compress_memory`

`ROADMAP.md` may start with a YAML frontmatter block declaring per-project preferences. The only field currently defined is `compress_memory`, used by the `compress-memory` skill:

```yaml
---
compress_memory: enabled   # or: disabled
---
```

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | `pause-work` invokes `compress-memory` on `STATE.md` after writing it, and on `ROADMAP.md` itself if it has changed since the last commit. Compression failures are logged and do not block `pause-work` (mirrors the `sync-github` graceful-failure pattern). |
| `disabled` | `pause-work` skips compression. Users can still invoke `/compress-memory <file>` manually. |
| (field absent) | Treated as `disabled` — backwards compatible default. |

The field is set during `plan-roadmap` via an opt-in question, but may be edited by hand at any time. Flipping `enabled` → `disabled` stops further auto-compression; existing compressed files stay compressed (`*.original.md` backups remain on disk for recovery).

The `compress_memory` field is the only field; do not invent additional keys here without updating this document and the `compress-memory` skill's safety rules.

### Edit transitions

Agent-driven mutations to ROADMAP.md follow these exact patterns. Use `Edit` tool with the before/after blocks below as templates.

**Phase: pending → active** (start of phase, via `start-next-phase`):

```markdown
Before: ### Phase 1.2: Auth [status: pending]
After:  ### Phase 1.2: Auth [status: active]
```

(no other changes; `**Started:**` is tracked at milestone level, not per-phase)

**Phase: active → complete** (end of phase, via `complete-phase`):

```markdown
Before: ### Phase 1.2: Auth [status: active]
        **Goal:** Add JWT auth with refresh tokens
        **Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-04-12-auth.md`

After:  ### Phase 1.2: Auth [status: complete]
        **Goal:** Add JWT auth with refresh tokens
        **Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-04-12-auth.md`
        **Completed:** 2026-05-04
```

(two changes: status bracket and new `**Completed:**` line below `**Plan:**`)

**Milestone: active → complete** (end of milestone, via `complete-milestone`):

```markdown
Before: ## Milestone 1: Foundation [status: active]
        **Goal:** Lay the foundation
        **Started:** 2026-04-01

After:  ## Milestone 1: Foundation [status: complete]
        **Goal:** Lay the foundation
        **Started:** 2026-04-01
        **Completed:** 2026-05-04
```

**Inserting a new pending phase** (via `add-phase` / `insert-phase`):

```markdown
### Phase 1.3: <New Name> [status: pending]
**Goal:** <one sentence>
**Surface:** <UI | Backend | Refactor | Data | Infra | Docs | Mixed>
**HelpWanted:** no
**Plan:** _to be written_
```

(`Plan:` placeholder is replaced when `writing-plans` actually runs. `Surface:` is required at insertion time so `start-next-phase` can route correctly when the phase later activates. `Issue:` is omitted — it gets written by `init-github-sync` on first GitHub-issue creation.)

## STATE.md

Session handoff document. Written by `pause-work`, read by `resume-work`.

```markdown
# Session State — <Date>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Current Position
- **Milestone:** <N> — <Name>
- **Phase:** <N.M> — <Name>
- **Last completed task:** Task N from `docs/plans/<plan-file>.md`
- **Next task:** Task N+1 — <task title>

## Open Decisions
- Decision 1 needing resolution
- Decision 2 needing resolution

## Blockers
- Blocker description (if any)

## Recommended Next Step
One sentence: what to do when resuming.
```

## MILESTONE.md

Current active milestone definition.

```markdown
# Milestone <N>: <Name>

**Status:** active|complete
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Target:** YYYY-MM-DD (optional)
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (when status: complete)

## Goal
One paragraph.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All planned phases complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Regression test PASS
- [ ] Release tagged in git (only when CONVENTIONS.md says "Milestone completion tags a release: yes"; omit otherwise)

## Phases
1. Phase 1.1 — <name> [complete]
2. Phase 1.2 — <name> [active]
3. Phase 1.3 — <name> [pending]

## Audit History
| Date | Verdict | Gaps |
|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | PASS | none |
```
