# Roslyn CodeLens — Superpowers Integration

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the roslyn-codelens MCP server (21 tools). Install via:

```bash
claude install gh:MarcelRoozekrans/roslyn-codelens-mcp
```

## Detection

Check if `find_implementations` is available as an MCP tool. If not, this skill is inert — do nothing. No errors, no degradation.

## Overview

This skill enhances superpowers skills with semantic .NET code intelligence. When roslyn-codelens tools are detected, use them **instead of Grep/Glob** for structural code queries and **instead of `dotnet build`** for diagnostics.

**Core principle:** Grep finds text. Roslyn understands code. Use Roslyn for structure, Grep for content.

## Announce Line

When this skill activates alongside brainstorming or refactor-analysis:

> "Roslyn CodeLens tools detected. I'll use semantic code intelligence for architectural context."

---

## Brainstorming Integration

When brainstorming is active on a .NET codebase and roslyn tools are available, enhance each phase:

### Phase 1: Explore Project Context

**Before asking clarifying questions**, build architectural context:

1. **`get_project_dependencies`** — understand solution architecture and how projects relate.
2. **`get_symbol_context`** on types mentioned in the user's request — full context dump (namespace, base class, interfaces, DI dependencies, public members).
3. **`get_nuget_dependencies`** — know what external packages are in play (frameworks, libraries, analyzers).
4. **`get_source_generators`** — check if source generators produce code relevant to the area under discussion.
5. Present architecture summary alongside your first clarifying question.

### Phase 2: Clarifying Questions

Ground your questions in actual architecture:

- **`find_implementations`** — know all implementors before asking "should we extend this?"
- **`get_type_hierarchy`** — understand inheritance chains before asking about extension points.
- **`find_callers`** — know the blast radius before asking "should we change this API?"
- **`find_references`** — comprehensive reference count to gauge coupling.
- **`find_attribute_usages`** — discover attribute-driven behaviors (authorization, serialization, validation) that constrain options.
- **`search_symbols`** — fuzzy-find related types when the user mentions a concept by partial name.

### Phase 3: Proposing Approaches

Back each approach with concrete evidence:

- **`get_di_registrations`** — how is the current wiring set up? What lifetimes are in use?
- **`find_reflection_usage`** — are there hidden couplings that constrain options?
- **`get_type_hierarchy`** — what extension points already exist?
- **`get_diagnostics`** — are there existing warnings or analyzer findings in the area?
- **`get_code_fixes`** — can any existing issues be addressed as part of the proposed change?
- **`get_complexity_metrics`** — is the area already complex enough to warrant simplification?
- **`find_circular_dependencies`** — will any approach introduce or break a dependency cycle?

### Phase 4: Design Presentation

Reference concrete types, interfaces, and call sites. Not "the services that implement the interface" but:

> "These 4 classes implement IUserService: UserService, CachedUserService, MockUserService, AdminUserService."

Use **`go_to_definition`** to link to exact source locations when referencing types in the design.

## Refactor Analysis Integration

When refactor-analysis is active on a .NET codebase and roslyn tools are available, replace text-based search in key phases:

### Phase 2: Direct Dependency Mapping

**Replace Grep with semantic tools:**

| Text Search | Roslyn Replacement | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Grep for type name in imports | **`find_references`** on the type | Finds every reference, not just string matches |
| Grep for method name | **`find_callers`** on the specific method | Excludes unrelated methods with the same name |
| Grep for interface name | **`find_implementations`** | Finds all implementors, including indirect ones |
| Grep for file path | **`go_to_definition`** to verify, then **`find_references`** | Semantic, not string-based |
| Grep for attribute usage | **`find_attribute_usages`** | Finds all decorated types/members accurately |
| Glob for related files | **`search_symbols`** for related types | Discovers by symbol name, not file name |

Also call **`get_symbol_context`** for each target — one call gives namespace, base class, interfaces, DI dependencies, and public members.

### Phase 3: Transitive Closure

**Replace iterative text search with semantic traversal:**

- **`get_type_hierarchy`** — walk up and down inheritance chains to find all affected types.
- **`get_project_dependencies`** — understand which projects are affected and in what order.
- **`get_symbol_context`** — for each newly discovered affected type, check full context for additional transitive impacts.
- **`get_nuget_dependencies`** — identify external package boundaries where the ripple stops.
- **`find_circular_dependencies`** — detect cycles in the dependency graph that complicate execution order.

### Phase 5: Risk Identification

**Replace text-based risk detection with semantic analysis:**

| Risk Category | Text Search | Roslyn Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| Dynamic references | Grep for string literals | **`find_reflection_usage`** — detects `Activator.CreateInstance`, `MethodInfo.Invoke`, assembly scanning |
| Attribute-driven behavior | Grep for `[AttributeName]` | **`find_attribute_usages`** — finds all decorated members accurately |
| Dead code | Manual inspection | **`find_unused_symbols`** — reference-based dead code detection |
| Complexity hotspots | Manual review | **`get_complexity_metrics`** — cyclomatic complexity per method |
| Naming inconsistencies | Manual review | **`find_naming_violations`** — convention compliance check |
| Oversized types | Manual review | **`find_large_classes`** — types that may need splitting |
| Compiler/analyzer warnings | `dotnet build` output | **`get_diagnostics`** — structured errors, warnings, and analyzer results |
| Auto-fixable issues | Manual interpretation | **`get_code_fixes`** — structured text edits for diagnostics |
| Generated code coupling | File search for `*.g.cs` | **`get_source_generators`** + **`get_generated_code`** — inspect generator output for coupling |

Flag any reflection-based reference as **high risk** — these are invisible to refactoring tools and IDEs.

### Phase 6: Safe Execution Order

Use **`get_project_dependencies`** and **`find_circular_dependencies`** to inform the topological sort. Project-level dependency ordering ensures cross-project changes compile at each checkpoint.

## Red Flags

1. **Using Grep for structural queries when Roslyn is available** — Grep finds text, not semantics. `find_callers` is always more accurate than grepping for a method name.

2. **Running `dotnet build` for diagnostics when Roslyn is available** — `get_diagnostics` returns the same errors plus analyzer results, structured as data. Never shell out to MSBuild when the MCP tool exists.

3. **Skipping `find_reflection_usage` during risk identification** — Reflection-based references are the most dangerous because they're invisible to normal refactoring. Always check.

4. **Not calling `get_project_dependencies` at brainstorming start** — Without the project graph, you're guessing at architecture. One call gives you the full picture.

5. **Reporting "no dependencies found" without checking Roslyn** — If Grep found nothing but Roslyn is available, verify with `find_callers` / `find_references` before concluding there are no dependencies.

6. **Ignoring `find_unused_symbols` during refactor analysis** — Dead code detection is free and prevents wasting effort on code that should be deleted rather than refactored.

## Relationship to Superpowers Skills

| Superpowers Skill | Relationship | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | **Always-on when detected.** Enhances all 4 phases with semantic code intelligence. Grounds clarifying questions and approach proposals in actual architecture. | Falls back to Grep/Glob when roslyn tools are not available. |
| `refactor-analysis` | **Always-on when detected.** Replaces text search in Phase 2 (dependency mapping), Phase 3 (transitive closure), Phase 5 (risk identification), and informs Phase 6 (execution order). | Falls back to the standard text-based approach when roslyn tools are not available. |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | **Indirect benefit.** Plans produced after roslyn-enhanced brainstorming or refactor-analysis contain more accurate dependency information. | No direct tool usage during plan writing. |
| `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | **Indirect benefit.** Subagents implementing plans get better context when plans were informed by semantic analysis. | Subagents can use roslyn tools directly if available in their session. |
| `decision-tracker` | **No interaction.** Decision tracking operates on cross-cutting decisions, not code structure. | Independent — both can be active simultaneously. |
