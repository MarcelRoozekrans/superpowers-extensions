# Project Conventions Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Make `project-orchestration` ask for and honor project-invariant technical decisions (stack, commits/branching, versioning/release, deployment) instead of hardcoding them.

**Architecture:** A 4th state file `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` holds the decisions. A new `init-conventions` sub-skill detects them from the repo, proposes, and confirms. A single **Commit & Release Protocol** section in `SKILL.md` is the only place that knows how to build a commit message or whether to tag; twelve call sites pass it a semantic triple (`type`/`scope`/`subject`) instead of carrying literals. A CI guard asserts no literal ever comes back.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown skill files. Node 24 for the guard script (`scripts/check-registries.mjs` pattern). No test runner exists in this repo — verification is grep assertions, `npm run lint:md`, `npm run check:registries`, and the new guard.

**Design doc:** [2026-07-17-project-conventions-design.md](2026-07-17-project-conventions-design.md)

---

## Scope correction from the design

The design named 10 commit sites + `complete-milestone`'s tag. Implementation review found a **12th site**: `audit-milestone` (SKILL.md ~L573) lists `**Release tagged** — check `git tag -l` for expected tag` as a definition-of-done criterion. On a project where releases are not milestone-tagged, that criterion can never pass, so the milestone audit fails forever. Same bug class; included here.

## Why this lands as ONE PR, not two

A split was considered (protocol + sites first, `init-conventions` second). It does not work: the protocol's step 1 is *"CONVENTIONS.md missing → run `init-conventions`, continue"* (the approved self-heal). Shipping the protocol without `init-conventions` leaves a dangling reference, or forces the "fall back to current hardcodes" behavior that was explicitly rejected. Land together.

## Open decision (needs a human call before Task 11)

`complete-milestone` will stop tagging on projects whose conventions say an automation owns releases. That is a behavior change for existing users. Under release-please this repo bumps on commit type:

- `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → major (2.0.0)

Recommendation: `feat` (new sub-skill + capability) **without** a breaking footer, plus an explicit note in the PR body. Rationale: the old behavior was a defect, not a contract — it produced wrong tags on any project not using `vN.0`. Confirm before Task 11.

---

## Task 1: Add the conventions template

**Files:**
- Create: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/templates/conventions.template.md`

**Step 1: Write the template**

Match the style of the three sibling templates (`roadmap-design.template.md` etc.): a `>` blockquote explaining who consumes it, then `**Key:** value` fields matching the state-file idiom (`**Surface:** UI`).

```markdown
# Project Conventions

> Written by `init-conventions`. Read by the Commit & Release Protocol before
> every commit and tag. Stable across milestones — re-run `init-conventions`
> if a convention changes. Do NOT hand-edit fields the protocol reads without
> re-running the sub-skill; it validates them.

**Established:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Source:** detected | user-stated | mixed

## Stack

**Language / runtime:** `<value>`
**Package manager:** `<value>`
**Framework:** `<value | none>`
**Datastore:** `<value | n/a>`

## Commits

**Format:** conventional | free-form
**Scopes:** enforced | free | none
**Scope source:** `<file | n/a>`
**Fallback when scope not allowed:** omit scope | map to `<scope>`

## Branching

**Model:** trunk | feature-branch | gitflow
**PR required:** yes | no | unknown
**Protected branches:** `<comma-separated list | none>`

## Versioning & Release

**Scheme:** semver | calver | milestone | none
**Released by:** release-please | semantic-release | changesets | manual git tag | CI | none
**Milestone completion tags a release:** yes | no
**Changelog:** auto | manual | none

## Deployment

**Deploy target:** `<where it runs>`
**Environments:** `<comma-separated list | none>`
**Deployed by:** `<mechanism>`
```

**Step 2: Verify the file exists and has every required heading**

```bash
F=plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/templates/conventions.template.md
for h in "## Stack" "## Commits" "## Branching" "## Versioning & Release" "## Deployment"; do
  grep -qF "$h" "$F" && echo "ok: $h" || echo "MISSING: $h"
done
```

Expected: five `ok:` lines, no `MISSING:`.

**Step 3: Lint**

Run: `npm run lint:md`
Expected: `0 issues`.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/templates/conventions.template.md
git commit -m "feat(project-orchestration): add conventions template"
```

---

## Task 2: Write the init-conventions sub-skill

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — a `## init-conventions` section between `## map-codebase` and `## progress`.

> **Consolidated 2026-07-17** after the Task 2 code review. Four rounds of patching had produced a section where each finding was answered by *adding* a defense at the point of challenge rather than relocating the rule to where it executes — the re-derive rule ended up correct in content and inert in position, three rounds running. This is a rewrite, not a fifth patch. Rules live where they fire; rationale lives in the design doc.

**Step 1: Write the section**

````markdown
## init-conventions

### When to Use

Once per project, at kickoff — invoked by `plan-roadmap`. Also invoked automatically by the Commit & Release Protocol when `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` is missing (self-heal on existing projects). Re-runnable when a convention changes ("we moved to release-please").

Unlike `map-codebase`, this runs on **greenfield and brownfield**. Greenfield needs it most — an empty repo has no conventions to observe, so they must be decided.

### Announce Line

> "Establishing project conventions. I'll detect what I can from the repo and ask you to confirm before recording anything."

### Process

Steps refer to each other by **name**, never by number.

1. **Detect.** Best-effort. Every signal is optional; never fail on a missing one. A field with no signal is left unset for **Propose** to ask — do not ask here, and never infer a value from absence.

   | Field | Signal |
   |---|---|
   | Language / runtime, Package manager, Framework | If `map-codebase` ran this session, read `docs/plans/*-codebase-map.md` — it already detected these. Otherwise apply `map-codebase`'s Process steps 1 and 5. Greenfield: no signal. |
   | Datastore | ORM config, connection strings, compose service images; else no signal. |
   | Commit format | `commitlint.config.js`, `.commitlintrc*`, husky hooks. Else sample `git log -50 --format=%s`: a clear majority matching `type(scope):` → `conventional`. No commits → no signal. |
   | Scopes / Scope source | A `scope-enum` rule → `enforced` plus the path of the file holding it. Conventional but no rule → `free`, `Scope source: n/a`. Not conventional → `none`, `n/a`. |
   | Scheme | Shape of `git tag -l`, ignoring any `<name>-` prefix — release-please monorepo tags look like `mypkg-v1.2.3`. `vX.Y.Z` → semver, `vYYYY.MM*` → calver, `vN.0` → milestone. Mixed shapes → whichever the 10 most recent tags mostly use. No tags → `none`. |
   | Released by | `release-please-config.json`, `.releaserc*`, `.changeset/`, or a release workflow. None **and tags exist** → `manual git tag`. None **and no tags** → no signal: absence of automation is not evidence of a manual tagging habit. |
   | Changelog | `CHANGELOG.md` present, and whether the release automation writes it; else `none`. |
   | Protected branches | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches --jq '.[] \| select(.protected) \| .name'`, joined with commas. Do **not** use the single-branch `/protection` endpoint — it answers for one branch and cannot enumerate a list. On `gh` failure → no signal. |
   | PR required | From the same response: any protected branch carrying `required_pull_request_reviews` → `yes`. Protected branches empty → `no`. On `gh` failure → no signal. |
   | Deploy target / Deployed by | Workflows with deploy/publish steps, `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, `fly.toml`, `*.tf`. The artifact or registry named is `Deploy target`; the mechanism is `Deployed by`. Neither found → `none`. |
   | Environments | `environment:` keys in CI workflows, `*.tfvars`, compose profiles; else `none`. |

2. **Handle re-runs — before any interaction.** If `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` exists, load it and diff detected-vs-recorded. No differences → announce "Conventions unchanged" and stop, having asked nothing. Otherwise carry the recorded values forward as the baseline.

   **A field with no signal is not a difference — the recorded value stands.** Detection failure must never downgrade a recorded value. Without this rule a `gh` outage proposes `PR required: yes → unknown`, the user confirms, and a network error has disarmed the branch guard.

   The diff ignores `Established`, which is write-once.

3. **Derive.** No signal can produce these. **Derive only fills fields that are unset — a recorded value stands.** Otherwise a user who set `Model: gitflow` (reachable only by editing at **Propose**, since no rule produces it) gets it silently reverted to `feature-branch` on every re-run, and the same for a `Fallback` overridden to `map to <scope>`. `Established` was already protected this way; these need it too. Changed *inputs* are handled by **Re-derive**, not here.

   | Field | Rule |
   |---|---|
   | `Established` | Today on a first run. Preserved unchanged on a re-run — it records when conventions were *first* set, not when last checked. |
   | `Model` | `feature-branch` when `Protected branches` is non-empty or `PR required: yes`; else `trunk`. |
   | `Fallback when scope not allowed` | `omit scope` — conventional commits permit a scope-less message, so it always lands. |
   | `Milestone completion tags a release` | `yes` only when `Released by: manual git tag` **and** `Scheme` is not `none`. Everything else `no`: an automation already owns tagging, and `Scheme: none` has nothing to build a tag from. |

4. **Mark uncertainty.** A value inferred without a definitive signal — a `git log` that looks conventional with no commitlint config — is shown as `(uncertain)` **in the proposal only**. The marker is never written to the file.

5. **Propose.** Present the filled-in fields as one block; on a re-run, show only what changed. Ask for every field still unset. Offer `conventional` and `semver` as defaults the user may reject — offered, never imposed.

   > "Confirm these, or tell me what's wrong. `[y / edit]`"

   If the user declines a field, record the default and mark it `(defaulted)` so the choice stays reviewable.

6. **Re-derive.** If the user changed any field a **Derive** rule reads — `Released by` or `Scheme` (feeding `Milestone completion tags a release`), `PR required` or `Protected branches` (feeding `Model`) — recompute the field that reads it, overriding the recorded value, and show the result. This is the one place a derivation overrules what is on disk, because the user just changed its input. Skipping it leaves a corrected `Released by: release-please` paired with a stale `tags a release: yes`, which double-tags.

7. **Write** `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` from [templates/conventions.template.md](templates/conventions.template.md). Keep the `#` title, the five `##` headings and the `**Key:** value` lines; omit the `>` blockquotes — they are fill-in guidance, not file content. Do **not** read this as "`**Key:**` lines only": dropping the headings fails VERIFY, whose remedy is to re-write from the template, which drops them again. In their place write one provenance line so the file is not anonymous:

   ```markdown
   > Written by `init-conventions`. Do not hand-edit — re-run the sub-skill instead; the Commit & Release Protocol reads these fields.
   ```

8. **VERIFY.** Re-read the file. All five `##` sections present, and no `**Key:**` line still containing `<` or a space-padded `|` — either means a field was never decided. `**Established:**` is a real date. On failure, re-write and VERIFY again; never continue with a failing VERIFY.

9. **Commit only `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md`, by explicit pathspec**, per [Commit & Release Protocol](#commit--release-protocol) with `type=chore, scope=state, subject=establish project conventions`. The pathspec is load-bearing: a self-heal enters here with the caller's files already staged, and a bare `git commit` would sweep them into this commit.

10. **Announce:** "Conventions recorded. `complete-milestone` will `<tag per the recorded scheme | not tag — release handled by <Released by>>`."

### Skip This?

No. Without it, every commit falls back to a format the host's lint config may reject, and milestone completion invents a tag scheme the project does not use.
````

**Step 2: Verify**

```bash
F=plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
grep -n "^## init-conventions" "$F"
awk '/^## init-conventions/,/^## progress/' "$F" | grep -cE "^### (When to Use|Announce Line|Process)"
awk '/^## init-conventions/,/^## progress/' "$F" | grep -cE "steps? [0-9]"
```

Expected: one line number; `3`; `0` (all cross-references by name).

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
git commit -m "refactor(project-orchestration): consolidate init-conventions"
```

## Task 3: Write the Commit & Release Protocol section

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — insert immediately before `## Sub-Skills` (it governs all of them, so it must read as a preamble, not as one more sub-skill).

**Step 1: Write the section**

````markdown
## Commit & Release Protocol

<HARD-GATE>
Every sub-skill in this file that commits or tags MUST follow this section. Do
NOT write a literal `git commit -m "..."` or `git tag -a` anywhere else in this
file. Call sites supply intent as a triple — `type`, `scope`, `subject` — and
this section decides the format. A CI guard enforces this
(`npm run check:conventions`).
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 1 — Load conventions

Read `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md`.

If it does not exist → run [init-conventions](#init-conventions) now, then
**re-read the file. If it still does not exist, STOP** — the user aborted at
Propose, or VERIFY never converged. Do not continue on faith: this file's top
HARD-GATE requires verifying the artifact before chaining, and continuing with no
conventions lands in the branch guard with every field absent. Do not guess a
format, and do not fall back to a hardcoded one.

This does not recurse: `init-conventions` writes and VERIFYs the file before it
commits, so its commit re-enters here with the file already on disk.

**A value may carry a trailing parenthetical** — the field's value is everything
before the first `(` that follows a space, and `**PR required:** yes (detected)`
reads as `yes`. This rule lives here, where fields are read; without it that
value matches no row in the branch guard and the guard fails open.

**`Protected branches: none` means the list is empty**, not a branch named
`none`. The guard splits on commas, so this must be stated or it yields a
one-element list. `init-conventions` also derives `Model` from whether this list
is non-empty.

### Step 2 — Branch guard

Read the current branch with `git branch --show-current`. If it returns empty
(detached HEAD) → **STOP**: there is no branch to check against, so the guard
cannot answer. Say so rather than committing.

Match it against `Protected branches`, which is comma-separated. **`*` matches
within one path segment**: `release/*` matches `release/1.2` but not
`release/1/2`. Matching is case-sensitive. This definition lives here, not in
`CONVENTIONS.md` — the file records the patterns; the rule that parses them
belongs where it executes.

| `PR required` | Current branch matches a protected pattern | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `yes` | yes | **STOP. Do not commit.** |
| `yes` | no | Proceed |
| `no` | — | Proceed |
| `unknown` | yes | **STOP and ask.** `unknown` means detection could not reach the host — usually `gh` unauthenticated. Never treat it as `no`: that silently fails open on exactly the branch the guard exists to protect. |
| `unknown` | no | Proceed |
| anything else, or the field is absent | — | **STOP and ask.** `Propose` lets the user type any value and `VERIFY` only rejects `<` and a space-padded `\|` — it never checks a token against its enum — so `Yes`, `true`, `required`, or a missing line all reach here. An unmatched row must never mean "proceed": that is the fail-open this guard exists to prevent, reached through the door the table left open. Escape the pipe as `` `\|` `` — a bare one in a code span still splits the table cell. |

The announce is per-row; one generic message is wrong on the catch-all, which
fires regardless of branch match. On a protected-branch STOP:

> "CONVENTIONS.md protects `<branch>` and requires a PR. Move to a feature branch
> before I commit orchestration state."

On the catch-all STOP, quote the offending value and point at the file — telling
a user on an unprotected branch to move to a feature branch is both false and a
remedy that fixes nothing:

> "`PR required` in CONVENTIONS.md reads `<value>`, which I can't interpret.
> Re-run `init-conventions`, or correct the field."

Never create the branch or open the PR automatically — that belongs to
`superpowers:using-git-worktrees` and `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`.

### Step 3 — Render the commit message

| `Format` | `Scopes` | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `conventional` | `enforced` or `free` | `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` |
| `conventional` | `none` | `<type>: <subject>` — the project's conventions say it has no scopes; do not render one. |
| `free-form` | any | `<subject>` |
| anything else, or the field is absent | — | **STOP and ask.** Same reasoning as the branch guard: an unmatched row must never silently pick a format. |

If `Format: conventional` AND `Scopes: enforced`, read the allowed scopes from
the file named by `Scope source` and check `<scope>` against them. **Read the
whole file** — do not grep for `scope-enum` and expect the array beside it. On
this repository's own `commitlint.config.js` the rule is on line 4 and its array
starts on line 5; the array may also come from a variable or another module.
**If the file is missing, unreadable, or its scope list cannot be read off it —
including when the array comes from a variable or another module — apply
`Fallback when scope not allowed` rather than assuming permission.** Treating an
unreadable config as unrestricted renders `<type>(<scope>):` unvalidated, which
commitlint then rejects — failing the commit, which the rule below forbids. The
Fallback branch (`omit scope`) provably always lands. When the protocol cannot
determine whether a scope is allowed, take the branch that cannot fail.

If `<scope>` is not allowed → apply `Fallback when scope not allowed`:

- `omit scope` → `<type>: <subject>`
- `map to <x>` → `<type>(<x>): <subject>`

Warn once per session when a fallback fires — once, not per commit; a phase can
commit repeatedly and the warning is information, not an alarm.
**Never fail a commit over a scope.**

### Step 4 — Tag

`complete-milestone` only. The table is keyed on **two** fields — keying it on
`Scheme` alone leaves `tags a release: no` matching no row while `yes` + `semver`
matches two, and two agents then diverge on whether to tag at all.

Render the tag in the shape the project's existing tags already use — take the
prefix from `git tag -l` (most carry `v`; some carry none, and release-please
monorepos carry `<name>-v`). Do not assume `v`.

| `Milestone completion tags a release` | `Scheme` | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| `no` | any | Do not tag. Announce: "Release handled by `<Released by>`; not tagging." |
| `yes` | `semver` | **Ask the user for the version.** Do not invent a bump — a milestone is not inherently major or minor. **If the user declines, defers, or says "you pick": do not tag.** Announce that no version was given and no tag was created, and that `complete-milestone` can be re-run once there is one. A question is not a terminal state; every other row here ends in tag-or-announce and this one must too. |
| `yes` | `calver` | Match the shape of the existing tags (`vYYYY.MM.DD`, `vYYYY.MM`, …) — `vYYYY.MM.DD` is not the only calver. **Calver carries no milestone identity, so two milestones completed on one day render the same string.** Before tagging, resolve the collision per the rule below — do not silently reuse the date. |
| `yes` | `milestone` | `vN.0` |
| `yes` | `none`, or anything unrecognised | Do not tag. Announce that the scheme is unset or unknown and no tag was created. `init-conventions` derives `no` whenever `Scheme: none`, so this is reachable only via a hand-edited file — but a table the protocol can fall off the end of is how the `vN.0` hardcode survived in the first place. |

Before tagging, check `git tag -l <tag>`. If it exists, **check what it points
at** — `git rev-list -n 1 <tag>`:

- Points at the commit being tagged → this is a re-run. Do not re-tag, do not
  fail; announce it is already tagged and continue.
- Points anywhere else → **STOP and ask.** Two different commits want one tag
  name. Under `calver` this is routine, not exotic: two milestones completed on
  the same day both render today's date.

Existence alone is not identity. A check that only asks "does a tag of this name
exist" reports the second milestone as tagged while pointing at the first one's
commit, and it announces success — it certifies the collision instead of
catching it. That is this branch's recurring failure: a green check that is not
checking.

After tagging, verify with `git tag -l <tag>` before announcing success.
````

**Step 2: Verify placement — it must precede every sub-skill**

```bash
F=plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
awk '/^## Commit & Release Protocol/{p=NR} /^## Sub-Skills/{s=NR} END{print (p<s && p>0) ? "ok: protocol precedes Sub-Skills" : "WRONG ORDER"}' "$F"
```

Expected: `ok: protocol precedes Sub-Skills`.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(project-orchestration): add Commit & Release Protocol section"
```

---

## Task 4: Rewrite the 10 commit sites as protocol pointers

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` at lines ~160, 179, 206, 276, 394, 598, 646, 724, 817, 869 (line numbers shift as you edit — locate by sub-skill heading, not by number).

**Step 1: Replace each literal with its triple**

Every site is `type=chore`. Full mapping:

| Sub-skill | Old literal | New triple |
|---|---|---|
| `add-phase` | `chore(roadmap): add phase N.M — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=add phase N.M — <name>` |
| `insert-phase` | `chore(roadmap): insert phase N.M — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=insert phase N.M — <name>` |
| `remove-phase` | `chore(roadmap): remove phase N.M — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=remove phase N.M — <name>` |
| `complete-phase` | `chore(roadmap): complete phase N.M — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=complete phase N.M — <name>` |
| `plan-roadmap` | `chore(roadmap): plan project roadmap (M1-M<N>)` | `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=plan project roadmap (M1-M<N>)` |
| `pause-work` | `chore(state): pause-work — phase N.M, last task: <desc>` | `type=chore, scope=state, subject=pause-work — phase N.M, last task: <desc>` |
| `complete-milestone` | `chore(milestone): complete milestone N — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=milestone, subject=complete milestone N — <name>` |
| `new-milestone` | `chore(milestone): start milestone N+1 — <name>` | `type=chore, scope=milestone, subject=start milestone N+1 — <name>` |
| `init-github-sync` | `chore(sync): init github sync — N issues, M milestones` | `type=chore, scope=sync, subject=init github sync — N issues, M milestones` |
| `sync-github` | `chore(sync): reconcile github state` | `type=chore, scope=sync, subject=reconcile github state` |

Each becomes, preserving the existing surrounding VERIFY/clean-tree language:

```markdown
9. Stage the files, then commit per
   [Commit & Release Protocol](#commit--release-protocol) with
   `type=chore, scope=roadmap, subject=plan project roadmap (M1-M<N>)`.
   Run `git status` and confirm a clean tree.
```

**Step 2: Verify no literal survives outside the protocol**

```bash
F=plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
awk '/^## Commit & Release Protocol/{inp=1} /^## Sub-Skills/{inp=0} !inp' "$F" | grep -nE 'git commit -m' || echo "ok: no commit literals outside the protocol"
```

Expected: `ok: no commit literals outside the protocol`.

Note the gate checks `git commit -m` **only**. `git tag -a` still lives in
`complete-milestone` until Task 5 removes it, so asserting it here would fail for
a reason that has nothing to do with this task. Task 5 widens the gate to cover
tags once it owns them; Task 9's guard asserts both permanently.

**The gate is blind to an 11th site, and grep cannot find it.** `pause-work`
hardcodes a message in *prose* — "`sync-github` may produce its own
`chore(sync): reconcile github state` commit" — with no `git commit -m` anywhere
near it. The gate greps for the *shape* of the bug rather than the bug, so it
reports "no commit literals" while a hardcoded message survives, and the note is
simply false on a project whose conventions render differently. Convert it to
"may produce its own reconcile commit (rendered per [Commit & Release
Protocol])". Task 9's guard must grep for `chore\([a-z]+\):` — the message
shape — not only for `git commit -m`.

**Step 3: Verify all 10 pointers exist**

```bash
grep -c "Commit & Release Protocol](#commit--release-protocol)" "$F"
```

Expected: **12** — the 10 sites, plus `init-conventions`' own commit step, plus the `pause-work` prose reference above. The earlier `11` predated the prose site.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
git commit -m "refactor(project-orchestration): route all commit sites through the protocol"
```

---

## Task 5: Make complete-milestone's tag conditional

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — `## complete-milestone`, step 7 and the announce line in step 8.

**Step 1: Replace the hardcoded tag**

Old:

```markdown
7. Tag the release: `git tag -a vN.0 -m "Milestone N: <name> complete"`. Verify with `git tag -l vN.0`.
8. Announce only after tag verification: "Milestone N complete. Tagged as vN.0. ..."
```

New:

```markdown
7. Tag the release per [Commit & Release Protocol](#commit--release-protocol)
   step 4. If `Milestone completion tags a release: no`, this step performs no
   git action — the release is owned by whatever `Released by` names.
8. Announce only after step 7 completes: "Milestone N complete. `<Tagged as
   <tag> | Release handled by <Released by>; no tag created>`. Ready to start
   Milestone N+1 with `new-milestone`."
```

Also update the announce line at the top of the sub-skill, which currently
promises "I'll archive the milestone doc, tag the release, and update the
roadmap" — it must not promise a tag unconditionally.

**Step 2: Verify**

```bash
F=plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md
awk '/^## complete-milestone/,/^## init-github-sync/' "$F" | grep -E 'git tag -a' && echo "FAIL: literal tag survives" || echo "ok: tag is now conditional"
awk '/^## Commit & Release Protocol/{inp=1} /^## Sub-Skills/{inp=0} !inp' "$F" | grep -nE 'git commit -m|git tag -a' || echo "ok: no literals of either kind outside the protocol"
```

Expected: `ok: tag is now conditional`, then `ok: no literals of either kind outside the protocol` — Task 4 removed the commit literals, this task removes the last tag literal, so the full gate can finally assert both.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "fix(project-orchestration): make milestone release tagging convention-driven"
```

## Task 6: Make audit-milestone's tag criterion conditional

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — `## audit-milestone`, the definition-of-done checklist (~L573).

**Step 1: Gate the criterion**

Old:

```markdown
- **Release tagged** — check `git tag -l` for expected tag.
```

New:

```markdown
- **Release tagged** — only when `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` says
  `Milestone completion tags a release: yes`. Check `git tag -l` for the
  expected tag per the Scheme. When it says `no`, skip this criterion — the
  release is owned by `<Released by>` and the absence of a milestone tag is
  correct, not a failure.
```

Rationale: unguarded, this criterion can never pass on a project that does not
tag per milestone, so `audit-milestone` fails forever and `complete-milestone`
is unreachable.

**Step 2: Verify**

```bash
awk '/^## audit-milestone/,/^## complete-milestone/' "$F" | grep -q "Milestone completion tags a release" && echo "ok: criterion is gated" || echo "FAIL"
```

Expected: `ok: criterion is gated`.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "fix(project-orchestration): gate the audit release-tag criterion on conventions"
```

## Task 7: Hook init-conventions into plan-roadmap

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — `## plan-roadmap`, Process.

**Step 1: Insert as a new step 2, after map-codebase and before the brainstorm**

```markdown
2. **Establish project conventions.** Read [init-conventions](#init-conventions)
   and follow it. On brownfield most fields are detected and the user just
   confirms; on greenfield they are decided here. This runs BEFORE the brainstorm
   so that stack decisions are settled and the brainstorm's scope guard (which
   defers library choices) does not have to carry them.

   **VERIFY:** `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` exists.
```

Renumber the remaining steps.

**Step 2: Leave the scope guard alone**

The existing guard — *"if the brainstorm starts converging on … library choices,
STOP and zoom out"* — stays correct and now has somewhere to point. Add one
clause: *"Stack-level choices belong in CONVENTIONS.md (already established in
step 2); per-milestone library choices belong to `new-milestone`."*

**Step 3: Verify the ordering**

```bash
awk '/^## plan-roadmap/,/^## new-milestone/' "$F" | grep -nE "init-conventions|brainstorming" | head -3
```

Expected: `init-conventions` appears before the brainstorming reference.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "feat(project-orchestration): establish conventions before the roadmap brainstorm"
```

## Task 8: Document CONVENTIONS.md in state-files.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/state-files.md`

**Step 1: Add a `## CONVENTIONS.md` section**

Follow the existing shape used for `ROADMAP.md` / `STATE.md` / `MILESTONE.md`:
purpose, canonical field syntax, who writes it, who reads it.

Include a **canonical syntax** subsection matching the bar set by
`state-files.md` L51-63 ("Allowed values, exhaustive… Capitalized exactly as
shown, no quotes, single space after the colon"). It must state the three rules
decided during Task 1 review:

1. **Trailing parenthetical.** The enum token is everything before the first
   `(` that follows a space; an optional trailing `(...)` carries provenance or
   detail and is ignored by the protocol. Enables
   `**Released by:** none (defaulted)`. Do not write this rule as a code span
   containing a space — markdownlint MD038 rejects it.
2. **`Protected branches`** is comma-separated; `*` is a wildcard matching within
   one path segment (`release/*` matches `release/1.2`, not `release/1/2`);
   matching is case-sensitive.
3. **Cross-field constraint:** `Scheme: none` implies
   `Milestone completion tags a release: no`.

State explicitly:

- Written by `init-conventions` only.
- Read by the Commit & Release Protocol before every commit and tag.
- **Not** compressed by `compress-memory` (it auto-compresses `STATE.md` and
  `ROADMAP.md` only) — but note that the `**Key:** value` fields must survive
  verbatim regardless, because the protocol greps them.
- Lifecycle: stable. Unlike ROADMAP.md it does not change per phase.

**Step 2: Update the `## Directory` listing** at the top to include the 4th file.

**Step 3: Verify**

```bash
grep -q "^## CONVENTIONS.md" plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/state-files.md && echo ok
```

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "docs(state): document CONVENTIONS.md as the fourth state file"
```

## Task 9: Add the CI guard

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/check-conventions.mjs`
- Modify: `package.json` (add `check:conventions`), `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (add to the `check-registries` job)

**Step 1: Write the guard**

Model it on `scripts/check-registries.mjs` (same reporting shape, exit 1 on
failure, node builtins only — no `npm ci` needed in CI). It asserts:

1. No `git commit -m` or `git tag -a` literal appears in `SKILL.md` outside the
   `## Commit & Release Protocol` section. (`git tag -l` is a read and is allowed.)

   **This is necessary but not sufficient, and knowing why is the point.** Tasks
   4 and 5 both found hardcodes that carry no git command at all — a commit
   message quoted in prose (`chore(sync): reconcile github state`) and a tag
   promised in prose (`Tagged as vN.0`). Both gates reported clean while the
   hardcode survived. Grepping for the *shape of the bug* misses the bug.

   So also assert the **claims**: no `chore\([a-z]+\):` anywhere outside the
   protocol, and no prose promising a tag (`Tagged as`, `tag the release`,
   `tags a release,`). A bare `vN.0` shape grep will **not** work — the shape
   legitimately appears where `init-conventions` detects it and where the
   protocol prohibits it, so the guard needs claim-phrase matching or an
   allowlist of those two sites.
2. Every sub-skill that stages files references the protocol link.
3. `templates/conventions.template.md` exists and has all five `##` sections.
4. Every field the protocol reads (`Format`, `Scopes`, `Scope source`, `Fallback
   when scope not allowed`, `PR required`, `Protected branches`, `Scheme`,
   `Released by`, `Milestone completion tags a release`) is present in the
   template — so the protocol can never reference a field the template does not
   produce.

Check 4 is the important one: it ties the protocol and the template together so
they cannot drift apart, which is the same failure this repo fixed in #112.

**Step 2: Verify the guard FAILS before the work and PASSES after**

**`git stash` does not work here and specifying it was a defect.** By the time
this task runs, Tasks 1-8 are *committed*, so the tree is clean and `git stash`
is a no-op — the guard would run against the fixed tree, pass, and "prove" it
catches a bug it never saw. That is the eleventh instance on this branch of a
check reporting something other than what it claims, in the task written to stop
exactly that.

Run it against a worktree at `master`, which still holds all twelve hardcodes —
the same technique `check-registries` used in #112:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/master-guard master
cp scripts/check-conventions.mjs /tmp/master-guard/scripts/
cd /tmp/master-guard && node scripts/check-conventions.mjs; echo "exit: $?"
```

Expected on `master`: **exit 1**, reporting the `git tag -a vN.0`, the ten
`chore(scope):` literals, and the prose hardcodes. Then on this branch: **exit
0**. Clean up with `git worktree remove /tmp/master-guard --force`.

**A guard that only ever passes proves nothing.** Name the specific violations it
found on `master` in your report — "it failed" is not evidence it failed for the
right reason.

**Step 3: Wire into package.json and CI**

```json
"check:conventions": "node scripts/check-conventions.mjs"
```

Add `- run: npm run check:conventions` to the existing `check-registries` job in
`.github/workflows/lint.yml` (reuse the job; it already checks out and sets up
node, and needs no `npm ci`).

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/check-conventions.mjs package.json .github/workflows/lint.yml
git commit -m "ci(suite): guard against commit and tag literals in project-orchestration"
```

## Task 10: Update the skill's own reference tables

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/project-orchestration/skills/project-orchestration/SKILL.md` — `## Quick Reference`, `## Relationship to Superpowers Skills`, `## Red Flags`

**Step 1: Quick Reference** — add an `init-conventions` row, and fix the
`complete-milestone` row, which currently claims it writes `git tag`:

```markdown
| `init-conventions` | Kickoff via `plan-roadmap`; self-heal when CONVENTIONS.md is missing; on demand when a convention changes | `docs/planning/CONVENTIONS.md` |
| `complete-milestone` | After audit PASS | `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/planning/MILESTONE.md`, git tag *(only when conventions say so)* |
```

**Step 2: Red Flags** — add a row:

```markdown
| "I'll just commit with `chore(roadmap):` like the examples show" | The examples are gone. Read CONVENTIONS.md and follow the Commit & Release Protocol — the host project's lint config decides the format, not this skill. |
```

**Step 3: Relationship table** — add a `decision-tracker` note that conventions
are deliberately a local file rather than a memory, because recall failures are
explicitly not chain failures and the protocol cannot be best-effort.

**Also fix the `finishing-a-development-branch` row**, which asserts
"`complete-milestone` handles milestone closure and release tagging." That is now
conditional, and no other task owns this line — Task 5's implementer found it
while auditing prose and correctly left it here. It is the last unconditional
tag promise in the file.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "docs(project-orchestration): document init-conventions in the reference tables"
```

---

## Task 11: Update README and confirm the release note

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`

**Step 1: Update the sub-skill count.** README L989 says `17 sub-skills`;
`init-conventions` makes it **18**. Also add it to the sub-skill table in the
project-orchestration section (the table that already lists the other 17).

**Step 2: Document the behavior change** in the project-orchestration section —
a short note that milestone completion now honors the project's release
mechanism and will not tag when an automation owns releases.

**Step 3: Resolve the open decision** (see top of plan) on `feat` vs `feat!`
before writing the PR body.

**Step 4: Verify everything**

```bash
npm run lint:md          # expect 0 issues
npm run check:registries # expect OK
npm run check:conventions # expect OK
npx commitlint --from master --to HEAD   # expect exit 0
```

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "docs(readme): document init-conventions and convention-driven releases"
```

---

## Task 12: Dogfood it

**Step 1:** Run `init-conventions` against this repository and confirm it
produces the worked example from the design doc — specifically
`Milestone completion tags a release: no` and `Released by: release-please`.

**Step 2:** Confirm that a simulated `complete-milestone` on this repo creates
**no tag** and announces that release-please owns releases.

This is the acceptance test for the whole change: the skill's own home repo was
the counter-example that started this work, so it must now be handled correctly.
